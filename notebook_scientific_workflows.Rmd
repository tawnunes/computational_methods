__Never create one single script with all the analysis__ 

Ideally each scripts stars reading a particular input/data and ends writing results
The first script will read and format the data, and the others have specific analisys. Needs to run the first one.

It's advisable to never sabe the workspace, but if you have an object that thakes a lot to run you can save as _.rda_ using _save()_ and to load the object after you can use _load()_.

#Each script

1. A header containing whi, how, when, where, and why METADA

2. Loading all package

3. Reads needed data, is good to comment all steps.
