The Rmarkdown can be used to write scientific documents. One of its features is to citate literature from _.bib_ files. To do this its necessary to have the .bib file containing your references and a _.csl_ file that contains the citation format. 

Than you add in the YAML header the following information:


__bibliography:__ ../filepath/literature-file.bib

__csl:__ ../filepath/citation-style-file.csl


Than to cite in the text you use __@__ and the format used by the reference manager that you used to creat the _.bib_ file, as:

Citing @name_word_date or @namedate

And the result shoul look like: @zuur_protocol_2010

## References
<div id="refs"></div>
